1) accept a string and display whether it is palindrom or not.

mystring = input("enter the string:")
reversed_string = mystring[::-1]
if mystring  == reversed_string:
  print("it is  palindrome string")
else:
  print("it is not palindrome string")



2) accept a string and display it. now accept slicing positions from and to , slice the string and display it.

mystring = input("enter the string:")
print(mystring)
start = int(input("enter the start number"))
end = int(input("enter the end  number:"))
sliced_string = mystring[start:end]
print("Sliced string:", sliced_string)


3) accept a string and display how many vowel characters are there inside it.

mystring = input("enter the string:")
vowels = "aeious"
count_vowels = 0
for  ch in  mystring:
  if ch.lower() in vowels:
   count += 1
print("Number of vowels:", count)


4) accept a string and display the characters which are repeated in the string
ri
mystring = input("enter the  string:")
count_word = 0
for ch in mystring:
if  (ch >= 0) in mystring:
      count += 1
print("number   of characters,count)





5) accept a string and find out how many words are there in it.


6) accept a sentence and reverse it.
	e.g.  hello world
		world hello

reversed_string = mystring[::-1]
